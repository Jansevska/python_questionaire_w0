# Question 1
# Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function.
# The first line of the code has been defined as below. def hello_name(user_name):

def hello_name(username):
    print(f"Hello {username.capitalize()}!")

hello_name("emili")

    
# Question 2
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing def first_odds():

#first_odds = list(range(1, 100, 2))
#print(first_odds)

def first_odds(list):
    list = range(1, 100, 2)
    return list

print(first_odds) #is it wrong? why it doesn't print???


# Question 3
# Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. 
# The first line of the code has been defined as below. def max_num_in_list(a_list):

def max_num_in_list(a_list):
    a_list = range(10)
    return max(a_list)

print(max_num_in_list) #??????


# Question 4
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, 
# but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).
# def is_leap_year(a_year):

def is_leap_year(a_year):
    if a_year % 4 == 0 and a_year % 100 != 0 and a_year % 400 == 0:
        return "It's a leap year."
    else:
        return "It's not a leap year."
print(is_leap_year(2023))


# Question 5
# Write a function to check to see if all numbers in the list are consecutive numbers. 
# For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. 
# The return should be boolean Type. def is_consecutive(a_list):

list_1 = list(range(1, 11))
list_2 = [1, 6, 3, 9, 4, 2]

print(list_1)
print(list_2)

def is_consecutive(a_list):
    if a_list == range(min(), max(), +1):
        return "Yes, the list is consecutive."
    else:
        return "No, the list is not consecutive."
#a_list = list_2  
print(is_consecutive(list_2))  #I don't know!
